# Firebase Authentication Silent Failure Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often difficult to debug, issue in Firebase Authentication.  When using methods like `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` or `signInWithEmailAndPassword`, invalid email addresses or network connectivity problems can lead to silent failures.  The SDK might not throw an error in a predictable way, making it hard to handle these scenarios gracefully.

The `firebaseBug.js` file shows how this can occur, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides a more robust solution.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Firebase: `npm install firebase`
3. Configure Firebase (replace placeholders with your project details).
4. Run `firebaseBug.js` and try with valid and invalid email addresses, and test with and without network connectivity.

## Solution

The solution involves more comprehensive error handling, checking for specific error codes, and handling network failures more effectively.  See `firebaseBugSolution.js` for the implementation.
