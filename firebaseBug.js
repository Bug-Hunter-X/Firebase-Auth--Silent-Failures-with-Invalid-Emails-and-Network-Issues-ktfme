The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's email address is invalid or if there is a network issue during the authentication process.  This can lead to silent failures without clear error messages, making debugging difficult.  For example, calling `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` with an invalid email might not provide a helpful error in the catch block.
